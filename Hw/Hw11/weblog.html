                    <h3>Hack</h3>
                    <p>If you are an engineer or developer tasked with building embedded systems (or software, devices, networks, etc.), one of your highest priorities is—or should be—identifying and minimizing potential data security vulnerabilities. To
                        effectively meet this goal, you need to understand how systems get hacked, and ultimately understand how to “think like a hacker.” Hacking is all about exploiting vulnerabilities. These could be design flaws, weak access controls,
                        misconfigurations, or many other issues. This article peeks into the mind of a hacker. As you’ll see, their process and mindset in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities are much different from how engineers approach system development.
                        What goes on inside a hacker’s mind? It’s an entertaining, chaotic, and extremely volatile place, so bring coffee (lots of it) and let's dive in.

            <p id="contmain">The most striking difference between hackers and engineers is in how they address a challenge. Engineers (and scientists, for that matter) are systematic. Problems are first defined and analyzed, a plan (or hypothesis) is formulated, and the
                hypothesis is tested. Results are then analyzed, as to successes and failures, and conclusions are drawn. This is the scientific method. It has served humanity well for hundreds of years. Hacking subverts this process. First, there is
                no plan, but rather a mission. Plans for a hacker are loose and flexible. Remember, a hacker is not building something that must stand the test of time. Rather, they are breaking in. They do not need to satisfy a manager or CEO; they only
                need to complete a mission.</p>
